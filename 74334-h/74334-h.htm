<p>In the history of a country whose growth has
been under circumstances like our own, every locality
abounds in unrecorded deeds of moral heroism
as worthy of notice as are many facts and
events which have become fixed in the historic
literature current among the masses. Even were
such deeds to find a place in local history, they
will necessarily be circumscribed in their influence,
and at best be so hidden among commonplace
matter as almost to escape notice; while to
attempt giving them the attention they deserve
in a general history would be futile.</p>

<p>In the present attempt to render a comparatively
unknown episode of our country’s history
the theme of a small volume, both these difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
will be avoided; and by so giving it the
prominence it deserves, thereby afford a better
understanding of the inner workings of the stupendous
machinery of our system of government.
The by-ways of our country’s annals are fruitful
in just such interesting and instructive themes.</p>

<p>One of the lessons herein taught is that positions
of honor and trust are not always proof
against cupidity and corruption; or, to speak
more plainly, under color of law men have been
known to perform the most lawless acts. The
story of the Vermont troubles has one rare quality—the
poor hard-working settlers were ultimately
successful; and for once the cause of the
humble cottager prevailed against the machinations
of the favorites of royalty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/line.jpg" alt="line"></div>

<p>Some one has truthfully remarked that the
character of a people is largely determined by
the natural features of the country they inhabit.
The peasantry of mountainous Switzerland are
proverbial for their bravery and hardihood, their
strong and innate love of liberty, and their pure
and exalted patriotism. Accustomed from infancy
to danger, dependent upon their own resources,
mingling day by day among the sublimest
works of Creation, their aspirations acquire a
buoyancy, and their spirits an independence, that
leaves an impress on their lives amounting to a
national characteristic.</p>

<p>Thus the brave pioneer, inured to hardship,
and depending on his ax for shelter, and on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
rifle for food and protection from wild beast and
lurking Indian, will acquire a fertility of resource
and vigor of limb, as in a measure to remunerate
him for the privations he endures.</p>

<p>The original settlers of the New Hampshire
Grants,—that territory now known as the State
of Vermont,—were of this sturdy, fearless, and
independent sort. It seemed as though they had
drawn inspiration from the snow-clad, storm-riven
mountains, at whose base their lowly thatched
cabins were nestled. The long and hard winters
taxed the energies of the new settlers for the
necessaries of life, and precluded the introduction
of luxuries that only degenerate. The stubborn
wilderness was to be felled; the latent productiveness
of the soil developed; hand to hand
encounters with wild beasts were not infrequent;
common safety demanded a unity of strength
against the crafty foe, and necessity begat friends
at the same time it rendered friendship a mutual
safeguard; and this unity of purpose, thus nurtured
and sustained, afterward displayed itself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
one of the most unique chapters in the annals of
American history.</p>

<p>The people of these Grants, known to the
world as the Green Mountain Boys, were worthy
the wild and romantic country in which they
lived, and the stirring times in which they acted.
Vermont was never organized as a separate colony
under England, and from the first that plucky
little community refused to submit to the domination
of the older colonies on her borders. Her
people seemed to imbibe a spirit of independence
from the free air and the everlasting mountains.</p>

<p>New York claimed a jurisdiction over her soil,
and a like demand was put forward by New
Hampshire and Massachusetts. But the brave
Green Mountain Boys, under the guidance of
such natural leaders as the Allens, Baker, Warner,
and others of like invincible spirit, kept the greedy
land-grabbers at bay. In short, Vermont never
had a government other than the supreme will of
her own people, nor acknowledged the authority
of any earthly potentate, until she was admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
on an equal footing into the Union of States, as
the Fourteenth luminary in the blue field of the
nation’s emblem.</p>

<p>Yet had this people no inconsiderable share
in the work of achieving that independence which
made the present of our country a glorious possibility.
They secured what they believed to be
their own rights, at the same time they contributed
to the adjustment of the claims of her sister
communities.</p>

<p>There is no pretension, in the present pages,
to giving what will be new to specialists in Vermont
history. But to the general reader, and to
the student of the philosophy of human events,
there is much, we hope, both new and instructive.
The firm bearing of the brave and hardy settlers
of the Hampshire Grants, and the important part
they played in the War of the Revolution, give
to the material of this little book somewhat of a
national interest. Indeed, but for timely services
of the Green Mountain Boys, it is more than possible
the cause of America might have been lost.</p>

<small>GEOGRAPHICAL OUTLINE AND SETTLEMENT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Stephen A. Douglas has been credited with the
remark that Vermont is an excellent place to emigrate
from. Though small in area, with a surface
singularly broken by mountain ranges, wracked
by frosts and covered with snows five months of
the year, yet her internal economy has proved favorable
to the growth of both brain and brawn:
in the halls of Congress, as well as in the pursuits
of science and literature, she maintains her
place right gallantly.</p>

<p>That long and irregular lake on the northwest
boundary bears the name of the great European
discoverer and explorer, Champlain, who
here sought, and vainly, for a northwest passage
to Cathay. The loveliness of its shores, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
unsurpassed picturesqueness of its islands, endear
it to the tourist. Twice it has been the scene of
a naval combat.</p>

<p>The Green Mountains,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> from which the state
takes its name, run lengthwise through the central
portion, about midway between the Connecticut
River on the east and Lake Champlain on
the west. The sides of these mountains are clad
with the perpetual verdure of their hardy evergreens,
the verdant mosses and winter grasses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
clinging to their towering summits. The principal
streams, rising among these mountains and
following the natural declivities, find their way into
this river and lake, except those flowing northerly
into Lake Memphremagog.</p>

<p>It was not until after the conquest of Canada
that any considerable settlements were effected in
the territory now known as Vermont. Situate
about midway between the French districts on
the River St. Lawrence and the New England settlements
along the Atlantic coast, it had very naturally
become the battle-ground of the contending
powers, and a lurking place of their respective
Indian allies. The early colonists of Massachusetts
and Connecticut, in their frequent expeditions
against the French in Canada, and while
traversing these woods as hunters and scouting
parties, had become familiar with the fertility of
the lands between the Connecticut River and Lake
Champlain. As soon as the danger attending
their settlement was in a measure removed, by
reason of Canada and New England coming under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the same King, swarms of emigrants from the
adjacent colonies poured into the country, and the
most available and valuable portions were immediately
taken up; and, as though by magic, the
wilderness developed into fruitful fields, and gardens
flourished where the wild rabbit had made
its home. At the beginning of the Revolution
the population was estimated at from twenty to
thirty thousand.</p>

<p>If not to be governed at all is to be governed
well,—and so it would seem to be in this instance,—the
remarkable exemption of the State
of Vermont from taxation at the close of the Revolution,
as compared with other States, added to
the fertility and cheapness of the land, attracted
settlers from many of the older communities, resulting
in large additions to population and resources.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br>

<small>ORIGIN OF THE LAND TROUBLES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Vermont, as has been well said, was born in
the midst of tumult and the clash of arms. No
other State, we can safely affirm, came up out of
such tribulation. Her experience is that of a
people exposed to the avarice and greed of officials
who scruple not to use the necessities of
their helpless subjects as a means of securing
their own selfish ends.</p>

<p>It was in pursuance to instructions from his
Britannic Majesty that Benning Wentworth, Governor
of New Hampshire, proceeded, in 1749, to
grant lands on the west side of the Connecticut
River, in the present State of Vermont, to such
persons as would settle and cultivate the same.
After the declaration of peace between France<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and England, Wentworth ordered that a survey
be made of the river for sixty miles, and that
three tiers of townships be laid out on either
side. In 1764 about one hundred and forty
townships had been granted to New England
settlers.</p>

<p>The lands went under the title of the “New
Hampshire Grants,” numbering sixty-eight proprietors,
each grant being six miles square, the
Governor reserving to himself five hundred acres
at the corner of each township. There were also
reserved four public rights, viz.: one to the society
for the propagation of the Gospel in foreign
parts; one for a perpetual glebe to the established
Church of England; one for the first settled
minister of the Gospel in town; and one for
the support of a school. The patentees, that is
to say, the possessors, were after ten years to pay
ninepence sterling per annum on each hundred
acres as quit-rent to his Majesty.</p>

<p>In addition to the five hundred acres at the
corner of each township, Governor Wentworth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
received fees and other emoluments in his official
capacity in making these grants. But he was
not always to pursue this career of pecuniary
prosperity. Other scheming brains, jealous of
his rapidly accumulating fortune, sought to deprive
him of his monopoly of land giving. This
menace lay in the persons of Cadwallader Colden,
Lieut.-Gov. of New York, and some associates
composed of lawyers and land speculators of New
York city.</p>

<p>As an initiative, Lieut.-Gov. Colden issued a
proclamation to the settlers on the west bank of
the Connecticut, Dec. 28, 1763, arrogating to the
government of New York sole jurisdiction over
the territory, founding the claim on the grant
made by Charles II to the Duke of York in 1664
and 1674, embracing among other parts “all the
lands from the west side of the Connecticut River
to the east side of the Delaware Bay.” Colden
at once commenced making grants of land in his
newly acquired territory, and by the first of November
following, his patents covered a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
portion of the lands occupied by the settlers who
had just paid for their titles to the Governor of
New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Gov. Wentworth now issued a counter proclamation
intended to inspire confidence in the grants
from New Hampshire, and exhorting the people to
be diligent in clearing up their lands, and not be
intimidated by the threats of New York. The
latter province thereupon made application to the
Crown for a confirmation of its claims, falsely and
fraudulently averring that such an arrangement
would meet the wishes of the people of the territory
in dispute. These claims were confirmed by
Great Britain in July, 1764.</p>

<p>Wentworth complained of this loss of territory,
and represented it to be injurious to the peace
and prosperity of the country; but he was constrained,
by advice of counsel, to recommend to
the settlers due obedience to the authority and
laws of New York.</p>

<p>Had this royal decree been interpreted by the
Yorkers as simply effecting a change of jurisdiction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the inhabitants would have quietly submitted,
as it was immaterial to them, other things
being equal, whether they lived in New York or
New Hampshire. Unfortunately, the private interests
of Colden and the land speculators induced
another interpretation. They maintained that
the decision had a retrospective application; that
the Connecticut River had always been the eastern
boundary of New York, and hence the grants
made by New Hampshire were null and void.</p>

<p>The people of the Grants were now apprised
of the true nature of the diplomatic game that
was being played, in which they were the parties
likely to be the most affected. They now realized
that the lands they had duly bought and
paid for, and for which they held deeds under the
authority of the Crown, were coveted by the land
speculators, and, under color of law, the latter
purposed to wrest them from their hands.</p>

<p>In 1765, a committee from the Grants waited
upon the newly-appointed Governor of New York,
Sir Henry Moore, to solicit his protection against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the New York patents; but this measure failed of
its purpose. The following year an agent was
sent to the Court of Great Britain to recount the
unjust proceedings against them; and the King
in Council, in response thereto, issued an order
bearing date of July 24, 1767, requiring of the
Governor of New York that he should not, “upon
pain of his Majesty’s highest displeasure, presume
to make any grant whatsoever of any part
of the lands in question, until his Majesty’s further
pleasure should be known concerning the
same.” This order was obeyed during the administration
of Governor Moore; but after his
death, which occurred in the fall of 1769, it was
wholly disregarded, and grants were made by
successive governors up to the Revolutionary period.</p>

<p>After the death of Moore, New York proceeded
to carry out its plan by attempting to compel
the Vermontese to repurchase their lands, or to
abandon them. Many of the settlers did not
have the ready funds with which to repurchase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
their homes, had they been so minded; while the
great majority peremptorily refused to submit.
This bold opposition was followed by actions of
ejectment at Albany, and judgments against the
protesting settlers, the original proprietors.</p>

<p>The Governor of New York exercised a little
judicious diplomacy by making a partial distinction
between the settlers on the east and west
sides of the Green Mountains, and, by winning
some of the leading characters over to his interest,
by that means divided the people. Some settlers
on the east side, by yielding up their New
Hampshire titles, had new or confirmation grants
from New York on payment of half fees. The
usual fee of the former colony for granting a
township was about three hundred dollars; but
under the latter it generally exceeded two thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>To promote a further division between the
two sections, New York gave civil and military
commissions to settlers on the east side. A new
county was erected there, and a log court house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and jail was built in the wilderness, eight miles
distant from any settlement. The Governor, by
this stratagem, partially brought the eastern
counties to coincide with New York, thus placing
the western district in the interior of the government.
He hoped in that way to compel their
submission; forgetting that men, who had braved
every danger and hardship attending the settlement
of a wild country, would not tamely submit
to be dispossessed. The contest now grew warm
and serious. Writs of ejectment were issued and
served; some officers were prevented by force
from serving their writs; the papers were returned
to the Supreme Court at Albany.</p>

<p>Ethan Allen, a proprietor under the Hampshire
Grants, accompanied by an eminent barrister
of Connecticut named Ingersoll, repaired to
Albany to answer in behalf of the Grants. When
the first case was brought, Ingersoll answered for
the defendant, supporting his plea by the royal
orders and instructions to Governor Wentworth
to make grants of land in the province of New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Hampshire, and also produced the grant and
charter to the settlers. The judge would not
admit them to be taken as evidence, on which Ingersoll
perceived the cause was already prejudged,
and withdrew from the defense.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

<small>RESISTING THE NEW YORK CLAIMANTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>On the return of Mr. Allen to Bennington, the
people met in convention, and passed a resolution
to support their rights and property by force, inasmuch
as justice was denied them by the intriguing
land-jobbers controlling the civil power
of New York. This was a bold stroke of one hundred
men thus to oppose the most favored and influential
colony under the Crown; but the Vermonters
rightly conjectured their quarrel was with
the governor of New York and a few land speculators
only, and not with the body of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Matters were daily becoming more serious.
Civil officers were opposed by the people of the
Grants; the latter were in turn indicted for riot,
and sheriffs were sent to apprehend the delinquents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
These officers were seized and severely
chastised <i>with twigs of the wilderness</i>; that is to
say, they were bound to trees and treated to an
application of beech rods on their bare backs, well
laid on. Every day produced new events: the
settlers resolved to form themselves into a military
association for mutual protection.</p>

<p>Before the close of the year 1770, committees
of safety had been organized for purposes of defense
against the New York claimants. These
committees afterwards met in general convention,
when important issues were to be determined.
Ethan Allen was commissioned Colonel Commandant,
and Seth Warner, Remember Baker,
Robert Cockran, Gideon Warren and others,
were appointed captains.</p>

<p>The Governor of New York had threatened to
drive the Vermonters into the Green Mountains,
which occasioned their taking the name of “Green
Mountain Boys.” The committees of safety passed
a resolution in general council, in 1771, that no
officer from New York be allowed to carry out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the Hampshire Grants any person, without permission
given by the committees, or the military
commanders. Surveyors of land under New York
were forbidden to run any lines within the Grants;
and transgressors in this particular were to be
punished according to the judgment of a court
formed among the military officers or elders of
the people.</p>

<p>“Hugh Monroe, an old offender, was taken,
tried, and ordered to be whipped on his naked back.
He was tied to a tree, and flogged till he fainted;
on recovering he was whipped again till he fainted;
he revived and underwent a third lashing till he
fainted; his wounds were then dressed, and he
was banished the district of the New Hampshire
Grants.” These severities proved a salutary lesson,
and the Green Mountain Boys became a terror
to their adversaries.</p>

<p>The convention next issued a decree forbidding
all persons taking out grants, or confirmations of
grants, under New York. This had the effect of
uniting the settlers very much in the common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
cause. About the same time the Colonial Assembly
of New York authorized the sheriffs to call out
a <i>posse comitatus</i> in case of opposition to the execution
of their office; and the Governor offered a
reward of £150 for Colonel Ethan Allen, and £50
each for Warner and five others therein named,
to any person that should take and confine them
in any jail in New York. As a measure of retaliation,
Allen and the other proscribed persons offered
a reward of £5 for the taking of John Taber
Kemp, Attorney General of New York, and
published the same in the newspapers of the day.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court at Albany, having awarded
a judgment on a writ of ejectment against James
Breckenridge, of Bennington, the sheriff of Albany
County summoned a posse to the number
of seven hundred and fifty men to go and assist
in serving the same. The officers collected about
three hundred, and reaching Breckenridge’s house
some hours in advance of the sheriff’s party, stationed
their men in ambuscade in readiness to receive
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>An officer and eighteen men were placed inside
the house. One hundred and fifty were secreted
behind trees, in a wood, near the road by which
the sheriff must pass, and where he would naturally
halt his men while he went to demand possession
of the premises. The other division was
stationed behind a ridge of land, in a meadow,
within gun-shot of the house, but out of sight of
the sheriff’s men. This arrangement of the ambuscade
enabled the Green Mountain Boys to
have a cross-fire on the Yorkers without endangering
themselves; and they were instructed to hold
themselves in readiness to commence the attack
in case the sheriff forced the door, the signal to
be a red flag hoisted above the chimney top.</p>

<p>When the sheriff and his party approached, all
was silent; and exultingly they marched directly
into the trap without being aware of their critical
situation. Mr. Ten Eyck, the sheriff, went to
the house and demanded entrance as Sheriff of
the County of Albany; and threatened in case of
refusal, to force the door. The answer was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
“Attempt it, and you are a dead man.” He repeated
his demand; and was answered by “hideous
groans from within.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, the two divisions exhibited
their hats on the points of their guns, which made
them appear more numerous than they really were.
The sheriff and his men, realizing the danger of
their situation, “and not being interested in the
dispute,” beat a hasty retreat, without a gun being
fired on either side. This affair served not
only to cement the union of the people, but also
to cause a higher estimate to be placed on them
by the neighboring colonies.</p>

<p>On another occasion, an armed party of fifty
men proceeded to Arlington, where they took
prisoner Captain Remember Baker, one of the
seven proscribed persons, severely wounding both
him and his wife. Baker was put into a sleigh,
and the party set out with all speed for Albany.
An express was dispatched to Bennington with
tidings of the occurrence. Ten men promptly
mounted fleet horses, and after a ride of thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
miles, intercepted the kidnapping party at a crossroad.
The ten horsemen impetuously charged
upon the fifty Yorkers; and the latter, supposing
them to be the advance guard of a larger force,
left their prisoner and fled. Captain Baker was
nearly exhausted with loss of blood; but he was
kindly cared for, his wounds dressed, and he was
restored to his wife and children, to their no
small joy, and that of his friends.</p>

<p>A report reached Bennington that Governor
Tryon was on his way by water to Albany, with
British Troops, with a purpose to subdue or destroy
the Green Mountain Boys. This was the
more readily credited, as the royal troops had lately
been used on Bateman’s<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Patent, in the colony
of New York, to quell some disputes about the
titles or rents of lands; and it was known that
the subsequent grantees of the New Hampshire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Grants had applied to the Governor of New York
for a similar favor.</p>

<p>The committees of safety met the military officers
to consult on the measures proper to be
taken. They felt themselves at a crisis that would
either compel them to submit, or take the field
against a royal Governor and British troops.
Having reflected on the justice of their cause, the
labor and expense of building and the cultivating
of their lands, they unanimously resolved “that
it was their duty to oppose Governor Tryon and
his troops to the utmost of their power, and convince
him and his council that they were punishable
by the Green Mountain Boys for disobeying
his majesty’s prohibitory orders of July, 1767.”
The elders of the people assured the military officers
that they would afford them all the assistance
in their power, and advised them to concert
among themselves the plans of defense, and then
withdrew.</p>

<p>A messenger was sent to Albany to ascertain
the truth of the report, and learn the strength of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the enemy and the order of marching. On his return,
the messenger reported that “the British
troops were wind-bound some distance below Albany,
and were destined to relieve the garrisons
at Oswego, Niagara, and Detroit, and that Governor
Tryon was not with them.” Of course all
preparations for a battle were suspended.</p>

<p>The Governor and land agents of New York
were in due time apprised of this “note of preparation,”
and were thus assured the Green Mountain
Boys would fight even the King’s troops on
provocation. This affair served the purposes of
Vermont as well as a bloody victory could have
done; and prompted the Convention to forbid “all
inhabitants of the New Hampshire Grants to hold
or accept any office of honor or profit under the
colony of New York, and requiring all civil and
military officers who had acted under New York
to suspend their functions under penalty of being
<i>viewed</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>The first settlers of Clarendon were adherents
of New York. Disturbances had often sprung
up in that place, and Mr. Spencer, who had acted
as Justice of the Peace under New York, had often
sent writs against the people. Colonel Allen
and a few hundred men set off for Clarendon, to
frighten Spencer out of the country. Acting on
information received of Allen’s intended visit,
Spencer fled into the woods, and was not to be
found when the party reached the house.</p>

<p>After scouting the woods in vain, they marched
three miles and put up for the night. Towards
daylight, Allen and his two men went again to
Spencer’s house. Forcing the door with a log,
they rushed in with their guns and pistols, crying
out for Spencer to appear; but he had not ventured
to return home.</p>

<p>As they rejoined the main force, a small dog
was discovered, which, unfortunately for the dog,
bore the name of Tryon. This animal they cut
into pieces with their swords for no other cause
than that its name was Tryon; they held up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
pieces of the dog on the points of their guns and
cried out—“Thus will we do with Tryon!” Spencer
was so much alarmed at these proceedings
that he fled to New York, and matters remained
quiet for a time.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1772, Governor Tryon, through
the medium of a minister residing in Bennington,
made overtures to the people of the Grants for a
pacification. He promised if they would send
agents to negotiate an accommodation, they would
be received and protected, only excepting Ethan
Allen, Seth Warner, Remember Baker, and Robert
Cockran.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Viewing” a New York sheriff with beech rods.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This proposal being accepted, Captain Stephen
Fay and Dr. Jonas Fay were sent to represent
Vermont before the Governor, to arrange for an
adjustment of claims. The most that was effected
was a cessation of hostilities until his Majesty’s
pleasure could be further known. During this
armistice, a surveyor named Cockburn was privately
sent to survey out and locate lands within
the bounds of the New Hampshire Grants. Ira<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Allen and a number of men went in search of him.
They found the offender at Bolton, one hundred
and thirty miles through an almost unbroken wilderness
to the north of Bennington. They broke
his instruments and allowed him to depart, with
an admonition never to be seen in those parts
again under pain of death. Only the partial armistice,
and the efforts for a restoration of peace
then in progress, saved Mr. Cockburn a severe
whipping.</p>

<p>Governor Tryon next essayed the plan of establishing
a colony of emigrants under the New
York proprietors. The settlers were to be
Scotchmen, and the colony was to be located at
New Haven Falls. Allen was duly apprised of
this, who, with a number of trusty followers, repaired
to the place and began the construction of
a block fort. The Scotch emigrants wisely sent
some agents to view the country before coming
in with their families; and learning the nature of
the dispute as to title, refused to have any more
to do in the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>One evening while Colonel Ethan Allen and
Levi Roberts were at the house of a friend by the
name of Richardson, they were surprised by two
sergeants and ten soldiers from the garrison
at Crown Point, all of them well armed. Allen
and Roberts were well known to the soldiers, and
realized they were caught in a trap, as, stimulated
by the reward on their heads, the soldiers
would be certain to take them before the New
York authorities. But even in this dilemma, Allen’s
presence of mind did not forsake him. Both
he and Roberts had their side arms about them,
and he judged the soldiers would not immediately
risk an open encounter. Calling for liquor, he
began to make merry with the men; and such
was his address, and his powers of conversation,
that they were actually forced to join in the revelry.
It was not long before the sergeants were
dismayed at beholding their men, one by one,
yielding to the seductive influence of their potations.
Yet the doughty Colonel kept lustily
calling for more liquor; and with well-feigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
huskiness of voice, pressed all to drink, swearing
they would merit his eternal displeasure if they
refused.</p>

<p>At length, after nearly all had rolled from
their chairs, stupefied by the quantities of liquor
they had swallowed, Allen demanded to be shown
to bed. He was answered that the sergeants had
engaged the only spare beds in the house. He
refused their offer to give up one of the beds to
himself and Roberts, with a maudlin remark that
two such jolly subjects of the King should have
the best the house afforded, and declared his intention
to sleep in the barn.</p>

<p>Leaving their guns in the house to disarm
suspicion, Allen and Roberts suffered themselves
to be conducted to the barn by the sergeants,
where they were locked up for the night. The
Colonel was apparently so far overcome with
liquor as to require the assistance of two men to
enable him to walk; and he reeled about, and
dropping down helpless upon the straw, fell off
into a drunken slumber. Even Roberts began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
have serious misgivings as to the condition of his
Colonel, whom he had seen drain glass after glass
during the evening, enough to turn the heads of
half a dozen men. But no sooner had the footsteps
of the retreating sergeant died away, than
the labored breathing of the Colonel suddenly
ceased; and sitting up, drew off his boots and
poured therefrom the rum that Roberts was
ready to swear he had seen disappear down Allen’s
throat.</p>

<p>Allen knew the soldiers had only repaired to the
house to allow himself and his companion time to
get sound asleep, when they would return and
surprise them. What was to be done, must be
done quickly. But Allen had no intention of
leaving without their rifles. While they debated
as to the best method of securing them, those
coveted weapons were brought them by Miss
Richardson, who had found means to privately
remove them from a window; then making their
egress from the barn, they hastily sought the
safety of the dark forest. An hour later the sergeants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
went to secure their prisoners, whom they
expected to find helplessly drunk, but the birds
had flown.</p>

<p>One Hough, of Clarendon, was persuaded to
accept the office of Justice of the Peace under
New York, and attempted to officiate as such. He
was taken before the committee of safety, where
he plead in justification that he was authorized
by the colony of New York. The committee
caused the resolution of the Convention of the
New Hampshire Grants to be read to him, forbidding
all persons holding any office under New
York, and then pronounced judgment on the
prisoner that he “be taken and tied to a tree, and
there, on his naked back, to receive two hundred
stripes; his back being dressed, he should depart
out of the district; and in the event of his return,
unless leave was granted, he was to suffer death.”
It is needless to add the sentence of whipping
was summarily executed. This occurred in January,
1775. Hough had signalized himself as being
very active in procuring the outlawry acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
against Allen and others of the Green Mountain
Boys.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Adams, of Arlington, was outspoken
in his denunciation of the Green Mountain Boys,
and counseled the people to purchase lands under
New York titles. The Doctor was cautioned to
keep silent, and not needlessly incur their displeasure;
but he declared he would free his mind,
and, providing himself with a pair of good horse-pistols
and other weapons, said he was ready to
silence any man who dared to cross him. He was
soon afterward surprised, and carried to the Green
Mountain Tavern at Bennington, where the committee
heard his defense. Of course judgment
was rendered against him, and preparations made
to carry his sentence into execution.</p>

<p>As was common in those days, a post some
twenty or more feet in height held the tavern sign.
On the top of this sign-post was a stuffed catamount’s
skin, showing large teeth, looking and
grinning towards New York. Dr. Adams was
tied in an arm chair and hoisted up to the sign,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
where he hung two mortal hours, as a punishment
for his treasonable utterances. A large
number of the citizens assembled to see the sentence
carried out, and they were loud in their
jeers and merriment at the Doctor’s discomfiture.
He was then let down, dismissed by the
committee, and admonished to go and sin no
more.</p>

<p>Colonel Ethan Allen was once on a visit to
his brother Heman, who was residing at Salisbury,
Conn. A plot was laid by some Yorkers to
capture and convey him to the Poughkeepsie jail,
and so obtain Tryon’s promised premium. Robert
M’Cormick, who was on intimate terms with
the family, had been engaged to act as decoy.
He was to spend the night with the family as
their guest, and at a convenient hour, open the
door and conduct the gang to the apartment
where the Colonel slept. A sleigh was to be in
readiness outside, in which their prisoner could
be driven with all speed out of Connecticut.</p>

<p>M’Cormick parted from his companions at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
some distance from Heman Allen’s house. He
was kindly received, and offered a bed for the
night. It was noticed he was unusually reticent,
and quite reserved in his participation in the hospitalities
tendered him. He made some indirect
inquiries after Colonel Allen, who had ridden out
that afternoon, but who was momentarily expected
to return.</p>

<p>From these circumstances Heman was led to
suspect some plot was on foot against his brother,
and so expressed himself on that gentleman’s
return. The Colonel thereupon taxed M’Cormick
at his unusual concern, and so pressed the poor
fellow that he confessed there was a plot to capture
him, and that he had come for the purpose
of privately informing him of it. M’Cormick departed
soon after, and told the gang of what he
had done. Preparations were made for defense
by the household, but they remained through the
night unmolested.</p>

</figure>

<p>The scene of this adventure was the birthplace
of Ethan and Ira Allen, from which, at an early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
age, they removed with their parents to the
Hampshire Grants. Ethan was remarkable for
the boldness with which he declared his opinions,
and a self confidence that was abashed by no consciousness
of ignorance. He acquired a wide notoriety
as a pamphleteer during the Vermont
troubles, there being no paper published there at
that time. His enemies tried to fix on him the
stigma of an outlaw; and even so careful a historian
as Irving is led to make the observation that
he was “a kind of Robin Hood among the mountains.”
The late T. S. Arthur once wrote of him
as being a “guerilla chief,” forgetting that he
acted under the direction of a committee of safety—an
authority universally adopted by the other
colonies during the Revolution.</p>

<p>Ira Allen was still further traduced. The
<i>Western Star</i>, a paper published at Stockbridge,
Mass., in 1797, styles him the “Vermont Land
Jobber;” and states he was at the time under arrest
for treasonable designs against the government
of Great Britain, concluding with the observation—“All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
humane men should shudder at
the idea of a halter; and many honest men will
rejoice if Allen’s liberation puts an end to his
restless career in future.” Allen, it seems, had
been charged with supplying the Irish, then in
rebellion against England, with arms: after eight
years of litigation he was acquitted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

<small>MANDATORY LAWS OF NEW YORK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The spirit of opposition and resentment had
risen so high because of the events recorded in
the preceding chapter, that New York was led to
adopt the most stringent measures of coercion.
The law which the wisdom of that colony devised
to meet the exigencies of the occasion was a curiosity
in American Legislation. It enacted that if
any person opposed the civil officers of New
York, or burned or destroyed property belonging
to subjects of that colony, or assembled for riotous
purposes, such offenders shall be adjudged
guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy, and
were to suffer death as felons. The law made it
the duty of the Governor to publish the names of
offenders indicted for capital offenses, with an order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
requiring them to deliver themselves up in
seventy days; in default of which the courts might
award execution against them the same as though
they had been tried and convicted—the death
penalty to be administered without the benefit of
clergy. All crimes, therefore, that had been committed
on the Grants, could be tried at Albany,
and a neglect to obey summons to deliver one’s
person into custody, was equivalent to a conviction.
Thus was sought to be evaded the dangerous
duty of serving processes on the Green Mountain
Boys, and they would convict themselves by
refusal to surrender without the inconvenience of
a trial.</p>

<p>If this law was remarkable, the answer of the
Green Mountain Boys was no less so. Said they:
“By legerdemain, bribery and deception, they
[the New Yorkers] have extended their dominion
far and wide. We are resolved to inflict immediate
death on whomsoever shall attempt the apprehension
of the persons indicted as rioters. We
will kill and destroy any person that shall be presumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to be accessory, aiding or assisting in taking
any of us; although they have a license by
the law to kill us, and an indemnification for so
doing, they have no such indemnification from
the Green Mountain Boys. If New York insists
on killing us to take possession of our vineyards,
let them come on; we are ready for a game of
scalping with them.” These sentiments were announced
by handbills and in the papers throughout
New England, with the design of deterring
New York from attempting to enforce the law,
as such an attempt would be certain to result in
an effusion of blood. The people of Vermont
maintained in this that they were merely contending
for justice, and that the officers of New
York, who were calling upon the inhabitants of
Vermont to obey the royal orders, were themselves
acting in open violation of the express commands
of their King.</p>

<p>A new interest may be awakened when the
character of the claimants is considered. The
Green Mountain Boys were the actual settlers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Each family had its log house in the midst of the
clearing, with luxuriant crops of corn and potatoes
growing among the charred stumps. These
pioneers had brought nothing into the woods with
them except what could be carried on horseback;
some even brought in their goods on hand-sleds
in winter, the infirm and children being drawn
by husbands and brothers. A few cattle, sheep
and hogs, shared rude sheds along with the horses.
The rewards of industry and thrift were beginning
to be realized. Many families lived remote
from each other, and weeks might often pass
by without meeting a neighbor. There was plenty
of room for the Yorkers if they wished to turn
farmers, and were willing to carve a home out of
the wilderness as others had done. But such was
far from their purpose. Besides, a farm ready
cleared, with a snug house and barn, is preferable
to one in the unbroken wilderness, when either
can be had for the taking—and so thought the
New York land-jobbers.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>

<small>AFFAIR AT WESTMINSTER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Colonel Allen collected the documents relative
to the several grants of the Crown, including that
to the Plymouth Colony, to Lord Say and Seal,
to the Duke of York, and some other papers, and
in 1774 published them in a book. This had
the effect of bringing the Vermont troubles into
notoriety. The newspapers everywhere were circulating
the proceedings, which resulted in stirring
up public sentiment against the Crown, as
it was supposed the Governor and Council of
New York were sustained in their claims by the
home government.</p>

<p>Hitherto the opposition to New York had been
confined principally to the inhabitants west of the
Green Mountains. As already stated, the policy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
of New York had been to divide the people in
their sentiment, by a conciliatory course in respect
to those living on the Connecticut River.
But now an incident occurred which had the effect
of arousing the spirit of opposition throughout
the whole extent of the Hampshire Grants.</p>

<p>In September, 1775, a meeting of delegates
from the several colonies met at Philadelphia, to
consult upon measures for the public safety.
This was followed by an almost universal suspension
of the royal authority, the courts being
closed, or adjourned without doing any business.
New York alone refused assent to the patriotic
measures recommended by Continental Congress.
The court of justice for the County of Cumberland,
on the Hampshire Grants, was to be held in
March of that year at Westminster. Much dissatisfaction
prevailed throughout the county, because
of the course adopted by New York, and attempts
were made to dissuade the judges from
holding the court, without avail.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the day appointed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the people of Westminster and the adjacent
towns took possession of the court house to prevent
the officers of the court from entering. The
opposing party appeared, armed with guns, pistols
and swords, and commanded the people to
disperse. This being refused, the judges and
their friends retired. About eleven o’clock at
night they again appeared and demanded admittance;
being again refused, they opened fire, killing
one man and wounding several more. The
wounded men, and some others, were seized and
dragged to prison.</p>

<p>The next day the people flocked in from every
part of the country. A coronor’s inquest was instituted
on the body of their fallen comrade, and
a verdict returned of “willful murder by the
Court Party,” some of whom were immediately
seized and placed in jail.</p>

<p>The news of this event spread far and wide
throughout the Hampshire Giants, and fired the
hearts of the stern yeomanry with an irrepressible
bitterness and rage against the authorities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
New York. A meeting of the committees of safety
was held at Westminster the following month,
at which spirited and patriotic resolutions were
passed, among which was a declaration “that it
is the manifest duty of the inhabitants, on the
eternal and immutable principles of self-preservation,
wholly to renounce and resist the administration
of the province of New York, until such
times as the lives and property of the inhabitants
can be secured thereby.” Indeed, such was the
state of feeling, that but for the ominous occurrences
preceding the American Revolution, which
for the time absorbed all minor considerations,
New York and Vermont would have been brought
to the direful issues of a civil war.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>

<small>ATTITUDE OF CONGRESS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that in the
overshadowing event of the great drama of the
Revolution, the disputed claims to jurisdiction
over Vermont were entirely forgotten. On the
contrary, New York improved the very first opportunity
to make application to Congress for a
recognition of her title to the territory. Then
New Hampshire, inasmuch as she had made the
original grants of the soil, memorialized Congress
for a recognition of her claims. Next Massachusetts,
fearing lest the others should proceed to
carve up the disputed territory as they could mutually
agree, interposed her plea for a portion, as
coming rightfully under her jurisdiction. So,
while Vermont was battling bravely with the common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
enemy devastating her borders, she had to
contend with the plots and baneful policy of three
beleaguering and powerful States; and she only
asked of Congress an independent sovereignty
and even-handed justice.</p>

<p>Thus were four factions asserting a right to a
jurisdiction over the territory, and each demanding
of Congress a recognition of its claims. That
body chose the wisest course practicable. It advised
each party to refrain from a forcible exercise
of authority over the disputed territory as a
preliminary measure to future adjustment. To
this New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire
readily agreed, and authorized Congress to settle
the whole matter in controversy.</p>

<p>But the Green Mountain State was of different
mettle. She had already declared herself free
and independent; she had boldly assumed the
powers of government, and had exercised those
powers in every part of her territory. She was
not willing to surrender her sovereignty at the
behests of a Congress by which her rights were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
not respected, and in which she was not represented.
She was ready, as she had ever been, to
bear her share of the war with Great Britain, and
her sturdy Green Mountain Boys had more than
once proved their valor and patriotism on the
bloody field; but she would not consent to resign
her just rights to the arbitrament of any body
of men under heaven.</p>

<p>In June, 1780, Congress declared “that the
proceedings of the inhabitants on the New Hampshire
Grants were highly unwarrantable, and subversive
of the peace and welfare of the United
States; and that they be strictly required to abstain
in the future from all acts of authority, civil
or military, over those inhabitants who profess
allegiance to other States.”</p>

<p>Undaunted by this reprimand, Vermont responded,
through her Governor and Council, that
she considered the same subversive of her inalienable
rights; that it was not in accord with
the principal on which Congress grounded its own
independence; and that it was contrary to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
provision of the Federal Constitution forbidding
Congress to meddle with the internal policy of
unrepresented territory. Vermont farther intimated
that if the present course was persisted in,
she would have no motive to continue hostilities
with Great Britain, and maintain an important
frontier for a country that treated her people as
slaves; but that it would remain for her to finally
appeal to God and to an impartial world, to say
who would be accountable for the awful consequences
that must ensue.</p>

<p>And now having outlined thus much in advance
by way of a better understanding of our
subject, we will proceed to treat more in detail.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br>

<small>FALL OF TICONDEROGA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>On the night of the 17th of April, 1755, a lantern
was hung out from an upper window of the
North Church of Boston. Never did the beams
of a tallow dip go forth on more momentous errand.
As the feeble rays shot out into the night,
few realized therein a symbol of the cause of Liberty
that was so soon to be consecrated with patriot
blood, and that was destined to create a refuge
for the oppressed of every land. Hostile
British troops were silently threading the dark
marshes, and this was the signal to the minute
men to prepare for their coming.</p>

<p>The British had placed guards on all the roads
leading out of Boston to prevent all intelligence
of the midnight sally from getting abroad; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the enemy had proceeded only a few miles when
alarm guns, booming through the night air, and
the clanging of village bells, showed that the
news of their approach was traveling before them,
and that the country was rising. An express was
sent back to Boston for a reinforcement, and Major
Pitcairn was detached to press forward with
all speed.</p>

<p>About seventy of the yeomanry of the country
had been drawn up in military array near the
church on the village green at Lexington. Pitcairn
halted his men within a short distance of
the church, and ordered them to prime and load.
They then advanced at double quick. The Major,
riding forward, shouted, “Disperse, ye
rebels! lay down your arms and disperse!” The
patriots refused to obey; nor were they put to
flight until eight of their little band were killed
and ten wounded. The victors formed on the
common, fired a volley, and gave three cheers for
their inglorious triumph. Colonel Smith now
arrived with the remainder of the force, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
march was resumed to the little village of Concord.</p>

<p>There the alarm had preceded them, arousing
the inhabitants in the dead hour of night. The
church bell called together the inhabitants. The
minute men seized their arms and paraded near
the church. Efforts were being made to conceal
the military stores. A horseman brought word
that the British troops had fired upon the people
at Lexington, and were then advancing in victorious
array upon Concord.</p>

<p>The excitement and indignation of the brave
patriots were fully roused. Some of the militia
marched down the road to meet the English
force, and reported it to be three times their
own. They now retired to an eminence about a
mile from the centre of the town.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock the British troops hove in
sight, with flags displayed and arms glittering in
the morning sun. A strong detachment took post
on the green, while parties were sent out to destroy
the military stores. The yeomanry from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the surrounding country were pouring in with
such arms as they could obtain, until the little
war-gathering on the height numbered nearly five
hundred. At ten o’clock a body of three hundred
dislodged the British from the north bridge, with
a loss of two men killed. By this time, the stores
having been destroyed, the enemy prepared to retreat.</p>

<p>The British troops were jaded with their long
night march, but there was no rest or safety for
them short of Boston. On their return march,
the adjacent rocks and stone fences formed convenient
breastworks, from behind which rustic
marksmen sent the deadly bullet full into their
ranks. Some were shot down: others dropped
from sheer exhaustion; the rest hurried on with
no care for their fallen comrades.</p>

<p>Before reaching Lexington, Colonel Smith
received a severe wound in the leg. About two
o’clock in the afternoon, they were met by a detachment
one thousand strong, with two field pieces.
This was the reinforcement that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
marched so gaily through Roxbury to the tune of
“Yankee Doodle,” in derision of the rebels. The
troops opened to the right and left, allowing the
retreating soldiers to throw themselves into the
hollow square to rest. A little after sunset the
pursuit terminated at Charlestown common. A
half hour afterward, a powerful body of men
from Marblehead and Salem came up to join in
the chase. Thus the ministerial troops narrowly
escaped being cut off. The British loss was
seventy-three killed, and one hundred and seventy-four
wounded; that of the patriots forty-nine
killed and thirty-nine wounded.</p>

<p>The cry for vengeance at this desecration of
American soil resounded through the land.—Measures
were concerted in council; the outrage
was discussed in cabin and palace, and around the
camp-fire of the hunter; while the voice of supplication
from altar and dwelling was heard, asking
the Almighty to bless the patriot cause.</p>

<p>As by common impulse, public attention was
turned to the British fortresses of Ticonderoga<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and Crown Point, against which retaliatory measures
could be employed with the best effect. As
these forts were located near the homes of the
Green Mountain Boys, and their hardy courage
fitted them for a duty of this kind, requests were
sent simultaneously from several of the provinces
to Ethan Allen<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> and his followers to surprise and
capture those places. The provincial Legislature
of Connecticut, though not openly sanctioning the
invasion, lent money from its treasury to those
engaged in it, and appointed a committee to assist
in raising troops and supervising their management.
The force finally engaging in the expedition
was about two hundred and seventy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
strong, composed of Green Mountain Rangers,
with the exception of sixteen men from Connecticut
and a score or so from Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Towards the close of April, 1775, it was evident
something of unusual interest was transpiring
in the Hampshire Grants. The labors of the
farm were neglected at a time when they would
require most attention, and with one accord each
sturdy husbandman shouldered his trusty rifle,
and silently betook himself to a journey.</p>

<p>The course of each led through the wilderness
toward a central point near Bennington; and, before
long, a motley array of mountaineers, in
rough garb but of tried strength and valor, were
gathered as though for some military exploit.
Colonel Ethan Allen was placed at the head of
the expedition,—James Eaton and Seth Warner
being second and third in command: the troops
arrived at Shoreham, opposite Fort Ticonderoga,
on the night of the 7th of May. Detachments
were sent off to Skenesborough (now Whitehall),
and other points, to secure all the boats they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
could find for the transportation of the troops to
the opposite shore.</p>

<p>About this time Benedict Arnold appeared
among them, thirsting for military glory. He
bore a colonel’s commission from the Massachusetts
committee of safety, and attempted to assume
command of the expedition. The Green
Mountain Boys, however, would follow no leader
but Allen, and Arnold was obliged to yield, engaging
to act as volunteer, with the rank but not
the command of colonel.</p>

<p>The night of the 9th of May had arrived, but
not so the boats for which detachments had been
sent in quest. Yet it was deemed best not to delay
the enterprise, and transportation was commenced
with the few boats at command. The
work proceeded slowly; day was about to break
when Allen and Arnold, with only eighty-three
men, had crossed. To wait another day would
lead to discovery by the garrison. Allen drew up
his men and announced to them his purpose. “It
is a desperate attempt,” said he, “and I ask no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
man to go against his will. You who are willing
to follow, poise your firelocks.” Not a soldier
shrank from his duty.</p>

<p>Guided by a boy, they mounted the hill silently
and at a rapid pace. Day was breaking as
Allen, with Arnold at his left hand, arrived at a
sally port. A sentry snapped his piece at him
and retreated, closely followed by Allen and his
men. Another sentinel thrust at Eaton with his
bayonet, but was struck down, when he begged
lustily for quarter. His life was spared on condition
of his leading the way instantly to the
quarters of the Commandant who was yet in bed.
Allen thundered at the door, and demanded a
surrender of the fort. The Commandant appeared
at the door half dressed, “the frightened
face of his pretty wife appearing over his shoulder.”
By this time the Green Mountain Boys had
formed on the parade ground, and were giving
vent to hearty cheers. The garrison were made
prisoners as they rushed forth in their confusion,
having been startled out of their sleep. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Commandant was bewildered at what he beheld,
and addressing Allen, cried out, “By what authority
do you act?” “In the name of the great
Jehovah and the Continental Congress!” was the
reply.</p>

<p>Captain Delaplace with forty-eight of his men,
a great supply of much needed military and naval
stores, and a valuable fortress, were among the
trophies of this brilliant dash of inexperienced
farmer soldiers.</p>

<p>Colonel Seth Warner, who had now come over
from Shoreham with the residue of the troops,
was sent with a detachment against Crown Point,
an express having been previously dispatched to
Captain Baker, of Onion River, forty miles distant,
to come with his company to assist. Captains
Warner and Baker appeared before Crown
Point nearly at the same time; the garrison, consisting
only of a sergeant and twelve men, surrendered
without firing a gun. Here were taken upward
of a hundred cannon. On his way down,
Captain Baker intercepted two small boats which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
had been sent to give the alarm to St. Johns, on
the Sorel River.</p>

<p>Arnold now insisted on being given the command
of the fortress, as being the only officer
clothed with legal authority. Allen was too popular
to be eclipsed by the assumptions of Arnold;
and the Connecticut committee, which had
accompanied the enterprise, gave an instrument
in writing investing Allen with full command of
the fort and its dependencies, until he should be
in receipt of orders from the Connecticut Assembly
or Continental Congress. Arnold was forced
to content himself, meanwhile, with a statement
of his grievances to the Massachusetts Legislature.</p>

<p>Just at this time a new project was set on foot
which had the effect to appease the restless spirit
of Arnold. The detachment originally sent to
Skenesborough arrived with a schooner and several
bateaux. Allen and Arnold arranged to continue
their conquests by an attempt to surprise
St. Johns, the frontier post of Canada. Arnold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
who had been a seaman in his youth, took command
of the schooner, which had been furnished
with cannon and ammunition from the fort, while
Arnold and his Green Mountain Boys embarked
in the bateaux.</p>

<p>Arnold outsailed the other craft, surprised the
post of St. Johns, and made its garrison prisoners;
captured the King’s sloop of seventy tons, with
two brass pieces and seven men; took four bateaux
and destroyed several others; and then, learning
that troops were on the way from Montreal and
Chamblee, spread his sails to the breeze and
swept up the lake with his prizes and his prisoners,
and some valuable stores.</p>

<p>On the way he met Allen and the bateaux.
Salutes were exchanged, cannon answering to
musketry. Learning from Arnold the particulars
of his victory, Allen determined to push on and
occupy the vacated post. The Canadian reinforcement
had already taken possession on his arrival,
so he returned to Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>This series of brilliant exploits was hailed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
if in requital for the recent acts of British atrocity,
and as an omen of a brighter future for the
colonies. To the adherents of the Crown it must
have been the occasion of astonishment and
alarm. It drew public attention to the prowess
of the Green Mountain Boys; and their leaders,
from being denominated outlaws, were now extolled
as patriots.</p>

<p>The capture of those frontier posts impressed
the American people with a sense of their ability
to cope with the disciplined soldiers of England,
and helped some to decide for independence who
had trembled in the balance, and at the same
time contributed to render preparations for defense
more prompt and effectual.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br>

<small>EXPEDITION INTO CANADA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Although these dashing exploits met with the
unqualified approval of public sentiment throughout
the country, yet Congress for a time wavered
as to the disposition of the captured fortresses.
An endorsement of those victories by that body
would destroy all chances of an ultimate reconciliation
with England, of which some entertained
strong hopes; others thought the day for a
peaceable settlement had passed, and insisted that
those victories should be followed by energetic
action. The Green Mountain Boys kept possession
of the forts until Congress had, so to speak,
legitimated their capture, and by its order, Colonel
Hinman’s regiment of Connecticut troops was
dispatched to relieve them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Another question had arisen as to which
should have the credit of capturing the posts, Allen
or Arnold. Both had sent dispatches to the
provincial authorities, with an account of the capture,
each claiming the honor of victory. “Colonel
Allen,” wrote Arnold to the Massachusetts
committee of safety, “is a proper man to head
his own wild people, but is entirely unacquainted
with military service; and as I am the only person
who has been legally authorized to take command
of this place, I am determined to insist on
my rights, ... and shall keep the fort at every
hazard, until I have further orders.” The Massachusetts
authorities referred the matter to Congress.</p>

<p>Allen had written to the Albany committee for
men and provisions to enable him to maintain his
conquest. That committee feared retaliatory
measures from Great Britain, and asked advice of
the New York committee; but that body was also
unequal to the task of acting in a matter of
such moment, and referred likewise to Congress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Both Allen and Arnold were ambitious for further
laurels, and each were anxious to lead an expedition
into Canada. Allen wrote to the New
York authorities in this strain: “If the Colonies
would suddenly push an army of two or three
thousand strong into Canada, they might make
an easy conquest, except a reinforcement from
England should prevent it. Such a diversion
would weaken Gage, and insure us Canada. I
wish to God America would, at this critical juncture,
exert herself agreeably to the indignity offered
her by a tyrannical ministry. She might
rise on eagles’ wings, and mount up to glory,
freedom and immortal honor, if she did but know
and exert her strength. Fame is now hovering
over her head. A vast continent must now sink
to slavery, poverty, horror and bondage, or rise
to unconquerable freedom, immense wealth, inexpressible
felicity, and immortal fame. I will lay
my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men and
a proper train of artillery I will take Montreal.
Provided I could be thus furnished, and if an army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
could command the field, it would be no insuperable
difficulty to take Quebec.” A letter in
similar strain was written by Arnold to the Governor
of Connecticut.</p>

<p>About this time Captain Remember Baker was
killed by an Indian in the British service. This
being the first blood shed in the northern department,
his death made more noise in the country
than would the loss of a hundred men toward the
close of the war.</p>

<p>On the arrival, at Ticonderoga, of Colonel
Hinman’s Connecticut troops, the greater part of
the Green Mountain Boys returned to their homes.
Ethan Allen and Seth Warner repaired to Congress
to get pay for their men, and to solicit authority
to raise a new regiment. They were received
with distinguished marks of honor by that
body. The same pay was awarded them that was
given to the Continental troops; and it was recommended
to the New York Convention that a corps
of Green Mountain Boys should be raised to serve
under officers of their own choosing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>To the Convention of New York Allen and
Warner accordingly repaired—the province on
whose statute books was recorded an unrepealed
act of outlawry against them—and boldly asked
for an audience. There was at first some demurring
as to their admission to the Hall of Assembly;
but patriotism, and an overruling necessity,
plead in their behalf. A regiment of Green
Mountain Boys, five hundred strong, was decreed,
and the people of the Grants were notified
of the resolve, and requested to raise the regiment.</p>

<p>Congress was not at first inclined to favor an
invasion into Canada, but subsequent developments
induced a change in its plans. The recent
exploits on the Lake had produced a favorable effect
on the Canadians, and it was thought they
would flock to the patriot standard were it unfurled
among them with an imposing force. Besides,
another effectual blow in this quarter might
paralyze all hostility, if given before there had
been time to rally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>That body thought General Schuyler a fit
leader for the undertaking, in which sentiment it
was heartily seconded by Washington. Schuyler
at once set about his duties amid difficulties that
well-nigh distracted him. He had calculated on
being joined at a certain date by the regiment of
Green Mountain Boys which Allen and Warner
had undertaken to raise in the Grants. But a
quarrel had ensued between those brothers in
arms, which filled the Green Mountains with discord
and party feuds. The election of officers
took place on the 27th of July, by committees
from the different townships. Ethan Allen had
been passed by, and Seth Warner nominated a
Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment. This was a
crushing blow to the ambition of Allen. He said
in his letters from camp: “I find myself in the
favor of the officers of the army, and the younger
Green Mountain Boys; but the old farmers on
the Hampshire Grants, who do not incline to go
to war, and whom I have saved from the encroachments
of New York, have met in a committee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
meeting, and in their nominations have wholly
omitted me.” Allen repaired to Ticonderoga,
where he was retained to act as pioneer on the
Canadian frontier.</p>

<p>The expedition against Canada had been determined
on. Arnold, more fortunate that his rival,
had attained the object of his ambition, which
was no less than the command of a force against
Canada: he was to proceed by way of the Kennebec
River.</p>

<p>At the beginning of September, Gen. Schuyler,
who commanded the main expedition, was
stationed with his little army at Isle Aux Noix, at
the outlet of Lake Champlain. From this point
he sent out Colonel Ethan Allen and Major
Brown to reconnoitre the country, distribute
friendly addresses among the people, and ascertain
their feelings. Then proceeding along the
Sorel River, he approached the fort at St. Johns,
when a cannonade opened, and a slight action ensued.
Night coming on, they cast up a small intrenchment
and encamped. Owing to unfavorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
intelligence they withdrew to Isle Aux Noix
to await the arrival of artillery and reinforcements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Allen returned from his reconnoitering
expedition, of which he gave a most encouraging
report. The Canadian captains of the
militia were ready, he said, to join the Americans
whenever they should appear with sufficient
force. He had held talks, too, with the Indians,
and found them well disposed. He was convinced
that an inroad into the province would
meet with a hearty cooperation.</p>

<p>Preparations were made for a second investment
of St. Johns, and Ethan Allen was sent to
beat up for recruits among the people he had
lately visited, while Major Brown was dispatched
with one hundred and thirty men to make friends
in the vicinity of Chamblee, and form a junction
with the army as soon as it should arrive at St.
Johns.</p>

<p>General Schuyler had been for some time the
victim of a complication of maladies. When everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
was in readiness for his departure, he
was attacked by a severe access of his disorder,
which compelled him to turn over the conduct of
the expedition to General Richard Montgomery.
He then set out in a covered barge for Ticonderoga.
An hour after his departure he met Colonel
Warner with one hundred and fifty Green Mountain
Boys, the first that had reported of the new
regiment. Some had deserted, and the remainder
were at Crown Point, whence they were about
to embark. About three hundred of the regiment
finally joined the expedition.</p>

<p>The investment of St. Johns was begun, yet it
proceeded but slowly. A letter had been received,
meantime, from Colonel Allen, giving high hopes
of further reinforcement. “I am now,” wrote he,
“at the parish of St. Ours, four leagues from
Sorel to the South. I have two hundred and fifty
Canadians under arms. As I march they gather
fast. You may rely on it that I shall join you
in about three days with five hundred or more
Canadian Volunteers. I could raise one or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
thousand in a single week’s time; but I will first
visit the army with a less number, and if necessary,
go again recruiting. Those who used to be
enemies to our cause come, cap in hand, to me;
and I swear by the Lord I can raise three times
the number of our army in Canada, provided you
continue the siege. The eyes of all America, nay
of Europe, are or will be on the economy of this
army, and the consequences attending it.”</p>

<p>Colonel Ethan Allen was on his way to St.
Johns when he met Major Brown with his detachment.
A conversation ensued, during which
Brown remarked that the garrison at Montreal
did not exceed thirty men, and might easily be
surprised. Allen’s nature was instantly aroused.
Here was an opportunity for another bold stroke
like that at Ticonderoga. A plan was forthwith
agreed upon. Allen was to return to a point
nearly opposite Montreal, and cross the river, by
means of canoes, a little below the town in the
night; while Brown agreed to cross with two
hundred men a little above; and the two detachments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
were to attack Montreal simultaneously at
opposite points.</p>

<p>The two parties, who were several miles from
each other, mutually agreed that in the event of
either being hindered from coming at the time
appointed, early notice should be given to the
other. The night proved windy, and Brown,
judging it dangerous to attempt crossing the river
in canoes, went quietly to rest. Allen, apprehending
no danger from the wind, on the night
of the 24th of September sent the few canoes in
his possession repeatedly across the river, first
taking the precaution of stationing guards in the
roads to prevent any alarm reaching Montreal.
As he had heard nothing to the contrary from
Brown, he supposed that officer to be carrying
out his part of the enterprise.</p>

<p>The day advanced, but no signal came from
Major Brown. It was evident he had not crossed.
Allen would gladly have retraced the steps he
had taken, but it was too late. Information had
been conveyed to the town, and a force of forty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
regular troops were sent out to attack him. A
smart action ensued; most of Allen’s Canadian
recruits gave way and fled; a number of Americans
were slain; at last he surrendered to Major
Campbell, honorable terms being promised, together
with thirty-eight of his men who remained
faithful to him.</p>

<p>The prisoners were marched into town and
delivered up to Colonel Prescott, the Commandant.
Their rough appearance and rude equipments
became the subject of much adverse comment.
“Their leader,” says Irving, “albeit a
Colonel, must have seemed worthy of the band;
for Allen was arrayed in rough frontier style; a
deer-skin jacket, a vest and breeches of coarse
serge, worsted stockings, stout shoes, and a red
woolen cap.” We give Allen’s own account of
the reception he met with:</p>

<p>“He [the Commandant] asked me my name,
which I told him. He then asked me whether I
was that Colonel Allen that took Ticonderoga. I
told him I was the very man. Then he shook his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
cane over my head, calling me many hard names,
among which he frequently used the word rebel,
and put himself in a great rage.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Major Campbell’s promise
of honorable treatment of his prisoners, Allen
was put on board the Gaspé schooner of war, and
heavily ironed—Prescott giving him the parting
assurance that he would yet grace a halter at Tyburn.
From his place of confinement he wrote
the subjoined letter to the General:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honorable Sir</span>:—In the wheel of transitory
events I find myself a prisoner, and in irons.
Probably your honor has certain reasons to me
inconceivable, though I challenge an instance of
this sort of economy of the Americans during the
late war to any officers of the Crown. On my
part, I have to assure your honor, that when I
had the command and took Captain Delaplace
and Lieutenant Fulton, with the garrison of Ticonderoga,
I treated them with every mark of
friendship and generosity, the evidence of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
is notorious, even in Canada. I have only to add,
that I expect an honorable and humane treatment,
as an officer of my rank and merit should
bear, and subscribe myself, your honor’s most
obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ethan Allen</span>.”</p>

<p>The following is appended by the British annotator:
“N. B.—The author of the above letter
is an outlaw, and a reward is offered by the New
York Assembly for apprehending him.”</p>

<p>After the prisoners had been conducted into
Montreal, General Prescott gave orders to a sergeant
and file of men, to put to death some Canadians
who had been taken in arms with Colonel
Allen. They forthwith went, with bayonets
fixed, to execute their commission. Allen, understanding
their purpose, stepped between them
and the Canadians, and told the guard to thrust
him with their bayonets if they must shed human
blood, but to spare the Canadians who deserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
no censure, as what they had done was in
obedience to his orders. The guards hesitated,
and Prescott being consulted, that officer revoked
the order.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>During Allen’s imprisonment he was confined
on board a man-of-war, commanded by Captain
Littlejohn, who exercised much clemency towards
his prisoner, and removed his irons except when
military officers came on board. A dispute arose
between the Captain and an officer, resulting in
arrangements for a duel. The Captain requested
Allen to serve as his friend. The latter replied
“if it was consistent with his situation he would
do himself the honor.” The Captain answered
that “he could change his dress, and go on shore
in disguise, and no questions would be asked.”
The parties went ashore, but by the interposition
of friends the dispute was settled.</p>

<p>At a later period, Colonel Allen was put on
board a ship under command of Captain Smith.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
He was heavily ironed, and confined in the most
dreary part of the vessel. When fairly out to sea,
Captain Smith ordered Allen’s irons taken off,
and requested him to eat at his own table while
he remained on shipboard. The Colonel came
from his dark abode and thanked the Captain for
his generous conduct, remarking “he did not
know it would ever be in his power to return the
compliment.” That officer replied—“gentlemen
did not know when they might render essential
services to one another.”</p>

<p>On board was a great number of prisoners,
who laid a plan to kill Captain Smith, and run off
with the ship. When the project was ripe for execution,
Allen was led into the secret. He firmly
told them if they murdered Captain Smith they
must also murder him, at which they were greatly
alarmed. He quieted their fears by saying, “drop
your plans, and I will be as faithful to you as I
have been to Captain Smith.” Here the matter
ended, and the Captain never knew of his danger,
nor of the service of his grateful friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Information had been received by Gen. Washington
of the indignities heaped upon Colonel
Allen, captured by Prescott when Commandant
at Montreal, and who was now, himself, a prisoner
in the hands of the Americans. Washington
wrote to General Howe to the following import:</p>

<p>“Sir:—We have just been informed of a circumstance,
which, were it not so well authenticated,
I should scarcely think credible. It is that
Colonel Allen, who, with his small party, was defeated
and made prisoner near Montreal, has been
treated without regard to decency, humanity, or
the rules of war; that he has been thrown into
irons, and suffers all the hardships inflicted upon
common felons.</p>

<p>“I think it is my duty, sir, to demand, and do
expect from you, an eclaircissement on this subject.
At the same time, I flatter myself, from the
character which Mr. Howe bears as a man of honor,
gentleman and soldier, that my demand will
meet with his approbation. I must take the liberty,
also, of informing you that I shall consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
your silence as a confirmation of the report, and
further assuring you, that whatever treatment
Colonel Allen receives, whatever fate he undergoes,
such exactly shall be the fate of Brigadier
Prescott, now in our hands. The law of retaliation
is not only justifiable in the eyes of God and
man but absolutely a duty.”</p>

<p>Washington observed in a letter to Congress:
“My reason for pointing out Prescott as the object
who is to suffer for Allen’s fate, is that I am
given to understand that Prescott is the cause of
Allen’s sufferings. I thought best to be decisive
on the occasion, as did the generals whom I consulted
thereon.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Washington received a
letter from Levi Allen, a brother to the Colonel,
and of like enterprising and enthusiastic character.
It was dated from Salisbury, Connecticut,
and enclosed affidavits of the harsh treatment his
brother had experienced, and of his being confined
on board of the Gaspé, “with a bar of iron fixed
to one of his legs, and iron to his hands.” Levi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
proposed to go to England, where he supposed
his brother was, raise a mob and set him free,
bribe the jailor, or in some way deliver him from
confinement. Washington kindly advised against
Levi’s wild project. The measure of retaliation
was actually meted out to Prescott, of which
Washington spoke in his letter to Howe.</p>

<p>The efforts of Washington and Congress to
effect the exchange of Ethan Allen, “the brave,
but eccentric captor of Ticonderoga,” were meritorious.
The daring exploits of that chieftain had
cost him a world of trouble. “Thrown into prison
as a felon; threatened with a halter; carried
to England to be tried for treason; confined in
Pendennis Castle; retransported to Halifax; and
now a prisoner in New York.” He writes: “I
have suffered everything short of death. I am
fired with adequate indignation to revenge both
my own and my country’s wrongs. I am experimentally
certain I have fortitude sufficient to face
the invaders of America in the place of danger,
spread with all the horrors of war. Provided you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
can hit upon some measure to procure my liberty,
I will appropriate my remaining days, and
freely hazard my life in the service of the colony,
and maintaining the American Empire. I thought
to have enrolled my name in the list of American
heroes, but was nipped in the bud.”</p>

<p>Allen was finally exchanged for Colonel Campbell,
after three years of captivity. Washington,
in a letter recommending that something be done
for him, observes: “His gratitude and firmness
seemed to have placed him out of the reach of
misfortune. There is an original something
about him that commands admiration, and his
long captivity and sufferings have only served to
increase, if possible, his enthusiastic zeal. He
appears very desirous of rendering his services to
the States, and of being employed; and at the
same time he does not discover any ambition for
high rank.” On the strength of this recommendation,
Congress voted Allen a brevet commission
of Colonel.</p>

<p>Montgomery, during his campaign in Canada,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
retained Colonel Warner and his regiment of
Green Mountain Boys, who contributed their services
to the downfall of the strongholds of Chamblee,
St. Johns, and Montreal; having served out
the time for which they had enlisted, they were
dismissed and returned home.</p>

<p>In 1776, soon after the death of Montgomery
at the storming of Quebec, the Hampshire Grants
raised a second regiment under Colonel Warner,
which marched to Quebec, and gave essential relief
to the besieging army of that place. At the
beginning of May the siege was raised in consequence
of the bad state of health of the troops,
and the arrival of reinforcements from England.
General Sullivan conducted the retreat in a masterly
manner; the army arrived at Crown Point
in due time, in a deplorable state.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br>

<small>ESTABLISHMENT OF A CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>This disastrous retreat exposed the frontiers
of the Grants to an invasive war; most of the inhabitants
of Onion River and along the shore of
Lake Champlain instantly removed, and the militia
was organized for the general defense. Internal
dissensions were rife regarding the establishment
of a civil government. Some were for joining
with New Hampshire; others were in favor
of forming a new state; and a few proposed uniting
with New York during the war; but this last
too much effected the title to lands to be seriously
considered.</p>

<p>Vermont was likely to be devastated as a common
battle-ground; yet the people met in Convention
at Dorset, January, 1776, and drew up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
petition to Congress, in which they declared their
readiness to furnish their quota of men in support
of the war, and bearing an equal proportion
of the expense, and asked that their rights might
be secured them. Congress recommended that
they submit to the authority of New York for the
present, and assist their countrymen in the contest
with Great Britain.</p>

<p>Colonel Allen being in captivity, Baker dead,
Warner, Cockran, and others, engaged in the army,
the Council of the New Hampshire Grants
was greatly weakened, and months passed without
any decisive results. The government of the
province was conducted by committees and conventions
as before the war, though the bitterness
of the dispute with New York seemed to be lost
in the common cause of the struggling colonies;
for those who had been outlawed for high treason
against the government of New York, now passed
freely through that province.</p>

<p>The following were some of the reasons for
forming a new State:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>A new government would perpetuate the
name of the Green Mountain Boys, and the honor
of their leaders.</p>

<p>A new government would establish the title
to their lands under the New Hampshire Grants,
and provide that unappropriated lands might be
disposed of to defray the expenses of the war.</p>

<p>The active part taken by her citizens in the
taking of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, would
entitle the State to a favorable consideration by
Congress.</p>

<p>That upon the revolutionary principles adopted
by Congress, Vermont was the oldest State in
America.</p>

<p>A call was issued for a convention, which,
after several adjournments, on the 15th of January,
1777, declared the district of New Hampshire
Grants to be a free and independent State.
A declaration and a petition to Congress were
drawn up, and a committee appointed to present
the same.</p>

<p>New York, alarmed at the possible consequences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
of the measure, wrote to Congress,
through the President of the Committee of Safety,
as follows:</p>

<p>“I am directed to inform Congress that by
the arts and influence of certain designing men,
a part of this state has been prevailed on to revolt.
Information we have received would lead
us to believe some persons in our sister States
have fostered and fomented these divisions. But
as those informations tend to accuse some of your
honorable body being concerned in this scheme,
decency obliges us to suspend our belief. The
Convention are sorry to observe that by conferring
a commission upon Colonel Warner, with
authority to name the officers of a regiment to be
raised independently of the Legislature of this
State, and within that part of it which hath lately
declared itself independent, Congress hath given
too much weight to the insinuations of those who
pretend that your honorable body are determined
to support those insurgents; especially as this
Colonel Warner hath been constantly and invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
opposed to the legislature of this State, and
hath been on that very account proclaimed an
outlaw by the late government thereof. It is absolutely
necessary to recall the commissions given
to Colonel Warner, and the officers under him, <i>as
nothing else will do justice to us</i>.” Congress
voted to dismiss the petition of Vermont.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this rebuff, the people resolved
to draft a constitution for the new State. A
committee was also appointed to visit the officer
in command at Ticonderoga, and consult with
him respecting the defense of the frontiers.</p>

<p>While the committee was at that post, Burgoyne
appeared in force on Lake Champlain, and
resting at Crown Point sent a detachment of
three hundred, mostly Indians, to land at the
mouth of Otter Creek, and ravage the frontier
settlements. The commanding officer at Ticonderoga
refused to send off any of his troops in
aid of the panic-stricken families, but allowed Col.
Warner to go with the committee to raise a volunteer
force from the Green Mountain Boys.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
A hasty levy was raised, with which the raiders
were promptly repelled.</p>

<p>All who were members of the Convention left
the militia and repaired to Windsor, July 4th.
A draft of the constitution was laid before the
convention and read. The matter under consideration
was new, of great moment, and required
serious deliberation; it was debated step by step,
and paragraph by paragraph. While absorbed
in their duty, an express arrived with tidings that
Ticonderoga had been evacuated, and that the
whole frontier of the Hampshire Grants was exposed
to the ravages of the enemy.</p>

<p>At this awful crisis the Convention was for
adjourning, as many of the members had families
residing in the portions likely to be overrun by
the enemy and their Indian allies. Indications
of a terrible thunder storm among the mountains
having put all thoughts of immediately going
home out of the question, some of the more
thoughtful called attention to their unfinished
work. In the midst of the peals of thunder, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
incessant flashes of lightning and the tumult of
the elements without, the constitution was read,
paragraph by paragraph, for the last time; and
as the sun broke forth upon a smiling landscape,
invigorated with the summer shower, Vermont was
in possession of a constitution, and stood pledged
to its support. A Council of Safety was instituted
to act during the recess, the Convention adjourned,
and the members betook themselves to
their homes.</p>

<p>Three days afterward, this “outlaw” Warner
and his proscribed Green Mountain regiment were
engaged in deadly conflict, on the soil of Vermont,
with the British and Indian foes of America, on
the memorable battle field of Hubbardton, in
which Warner’s force was decimated to about
ninety men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br>

<small>BATTLE OF BENNINGTON.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The British were of opinion that the people
of the Grants were opposed to the Revolution,
and would join the standard of England the moment
a force was marched into the territory.
This belief was founded on the dissensions with
New York, the unsatisfactory resolutions of Congress,
and the charges of outlawry brought
against the people of the Grants by their neighbors.</p>

<p>Bennington was a central place, whither the
live stock had been collected, and whence the
American army derived its supplies. It was likewise
a depot of wheeled vehicles and grain deposits,
and was guarded by relieving bodies of
militia. Bennington was to be surprised. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
country was to be scoured from Rockingham to
Otter Creek. All public magazines were to be
sacked. All cattle belonging to royalists, and
which could be spared by their owners, were to
be paid for; and all the rebel herds and flocks
were to be driven away.</p>

<p>Colonel Skene, the noted royalist after whom
Skenesborough (now Whitehall) was named, held
a position in the expedition: indeed, it was owing
largely to his representations that it was undertaken.
Lieut.-Col. Baum was sent in charge of the
detachment. He had in his command two hundred
dismounted dragoons of the regiment of
Riedesel, Captain Frazer’s British marksmen,
some Canadian Tories, and Indians, in all amounting
to about five hundred men, with two pieces of
cannon. It was expected the dragoons would
supply themselves with horses in the course of
the foray, and a skeleton corps of royalists would
be filled up with recruits.</p>

<p>Burgoyne encamped on the east side of the
Hudson, so as to be near at hand in case assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
was wanted. Baum set out from camp at
break of day on the 13th of August, 1777. The
state of the roads, the excessive heat, and want of
horses and wagons, all contributed to render the
progress slow and tedious. A few horses were
brought in, and some wagons captured; but the
inhabitants managed to remove most of their effects
in time. The Indians killed or drove off all
that came into their hands, unless they were paid
in cash for their prizes.</p>

<p>Baum found the people of Bennington ready
to give him a reception. The veteran Stark was
there, with eight hundred New Hampshire militia;
and Colonel Warner found himself at the
head of about six hundred Green Mountain Boys,
hastily collected to repel the invaders. Thus
once more the cause of American Independence
was to rest largely on the valor and patriotism
of the outlawed Warner and his band of brave
followers.</p>

<p>Stark had, with difficulty, been prevailed on
to take the command. He had a farm among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Vermont Mountains, and his sympathies were in
harmony with her people; he, too, was smarting
under a sense of the injustice of Congress. He
only took up arms, he said, in a moment of exigency,
to defend the neighborhood which otherwise
would be exposed to the ravages of the
enemy.</p>

<p>On the 15th, Stark sent forward a detachment
under Colonel Gregg, and on the following day
advanced with his own men to support them.
He met them about five miles off, in full retreat,
with Baum and his force a mile or more in the
rear.</p>

<p>Stark now halted, and deployed his men for
action. Baum drew up his troops and formed
them in a strong position on high ground at a
bend of a little river, and began to intrench.
Stark fell back to await reinforcements, and to
entice Baum from his intrenchments. A skirmish
took place in which thirty of Baum’s men and
two Indian Chiefs were killed.</p>

<p>The incessant rain of the 15th prevented a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
general engagement, but there was continual
skirmishing. Baum employed the interim in
strengthening his position; and finding the opposite
force much larger than he anticipated, he
had sent off in all haste to Burgoyne for reinforcements.
The latter immediately detached Col.
Breyman with five hundred Hessian Grenadiers
and infantry, and two six pounders, leaving behind
him his tents, baggage and standards. So bad
were the roads, that Breyman was nearly two
days getting little more than twenty miles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile expresses had been sent in every
direction by the Americans, and recruits were
pouring in from all parts of the country:—among
them, Colonel Symonds with a body of Berkshire
militia.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th, the sun was
shining brightly, and Stark prepared to attack
Baum in his intrenchments, although, for the
most part, his men had only ordinary firelocks
without bayonets. He separated his force into
two divisions: one was detached to the enemy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
left under Colonel Nichols; a second, under Col.
Herrick, was sent to the rear of his right; these
two were to join and attack the British in the
rear, while the third was to make a demonstration
in front.</p>

<p>Col. Skene and other royalists, when they saw
the Americans issuing from the woods on different
sides, endeavored to persuade Baum that
these were some of the Tories flocking to his
standard. The Indians were the first to discover
the error. “The woods are full of Yankees,”
they shouted; and retreated, yelling like demons,
between the troops of Nichols and Herrick.
Several of them were killed as they ran the gauntlet.</p>

<p>At the first sound of firearms, Stark, who had
remained behind in camp, mounted his horse and
gave the word <i>forward</i>! The homely speech
made by him when in sight of the enemy is familiar
to every school boy. “Now, my men! there
are the red-coats! Before night they are ours, or
Molly Stark will be a widow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>Baum found himself assaulted on every side,
but he fought with a dogged stubbornness and
determination. He planted his cannon advantageously,
and his fire was effective. Stark, who
was in the battle of Bunker Hill, and in engagements
in the French war, says it was the hottest
fight he ever saw. He inspired his men with his
own impetuosity. They drove the royalists upon
the Hessians, and pressing after them, mounted
the works with incredible fury. A Hessian eyewitness
declared the rebels fought with desperation,
advancing to within eight paces of the loaded
cannon to take surer aim at the artillerists. The
latter were slain and the cannon captured. The
royalists and Canadians took to flight and escaped
to the woods. The Hessians maintained
their ground until the last cartridge was expended;
then taking their broadswords, Baum and his
men attempted to cut their way to a road in the
woods. Many were killed in the attempt, and
the survivors were taken prisoners. Baum was
among the wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>The victors now dispersed; some to collect
the booty, or seek refreshments, and others to
care for the wounded or look after the prisoners.
At this juncture Breyman’s tardy reinforcement
came up, making its slow and toilsome way to
the scene of action, with numbers augmented by
many of the enemy that had fled. Stark made
superhuman efforts to rally his men, but all were
in hopeless confusion. Just as the day seemed
lost to the Americans, the standard of Colonel
Warner came in sight, borne by his six hundred
Green Mountain Boys, fresh from repose, and
eager for the fray; for were not the safety of
their homes, and the fate of their wives and
children, dependent on the issues of their arms?</p>

<p>The shock and tumult of battle broke out
anew as these newly arrived reinforcements joined
in deadly strife, and the ground was to be fought
over once more. It was four in the afternoon
when this second action commenced. Stark’s
men rallied, and entered again into the fight;
Col. Breyman’s command was driven before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
patriot forces from wood to wood, and from hill
to hill, until sunset. The last stand of the enemy
was at Van Shaick’s mill, where, having expended
all their ammunition, the enemy retreated under
cover of night, leaving two field pieces and all
their baggage in the hands of the Americans.</p>

<p>Burgoyne was awakened in the night with the
intelligence that Baum had met and surrendered
to the enemy. Next came word that Breyman
was engaged in severe and doubtful conflict.
Drums beat to arms. The whole camp was
roused, and Burgoyne was preparing to march
his whole army to Breyman’s assistance, when
word came in that he was on his way back in safety.
The main army remained in camp at the
Batten Kiln, but Burgoyne forded that stream and
pushed forward until he met Breyman and his
troops, haggard and fatigued from hard fighting
and incessant marching in the hot weather. Four
brass field pieces, nine hundred dragoon swords,
one thousand stand of arms, and four ammunition
wagons were the fruits of the victory. Thirty-two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
officers and four hundred and sixty-four
privates were taken prisoners. The Americans
lost one hundred in killed and wounded. The
British killed could not be ascertained, as many
had fallen in the woods. Stark remarked, that
had there been another hour of daylight, the
whole British force would have fallen into their
hands.</p>

<p>Tidings of the affair at Bennington reached
Washington just before he moved his camp from
the neighborhood of Philadelphia, and it relieved
his mind of a load of anxiety. In a letter
to Putnam he wrote: “As there is not now the
least danger of General Howe’s going to New
England, I hope the whole force of the country
will turn out, and by following the great stroke
struck by General Stark near Bennington, entirely
crush Burgoyne, who seems to be in want of
almost everything.”</p>

<p>The compliment paid to the troops of Vermont
by General Burgoyne, was to this effect:
“The district of the New Hampshire Grants, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
wilderness little known in the last war, now
abounds with the most active, rebellious and hardy
race of men on the continent, who hang like a
gathering storm, ready to burst on my left.”
This was written shortly previous to his capitulation.
This brilliant double victory at Bennington,
by relieving New England from apprehensions,
and enabling the patriots to concentrate
their forces against Burgoyne, resulted in
forcing that General to surrender, on the plains
of Saratoga, as noble an army as was ever sent
to subdue a country. The news spread through
America and Europe, sealed the alliance between
France and the United States, and so secured
their independence.</p>

<p>In the next chapter we will relate how this
timely service of the Green Mountain Boys was
requited by Congress. It is not within the range
of human wisdom to say what would have been
the effect on the American cause, had the demand
of New York been complied with, and
Stark and Warner been stripped of their commissions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
before the battle of Bennington. The enemy
would have been left to devastate the country
at their pleasure, and by diverting the patriot
stores in and around Bennington to the use of
Burgoyne’s army, thereby rendered his position
well-nigh impregnable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br>

<small>PRIVATE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BRITISH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Brilliant and signal as had been the feats of
these Vermonters with the sword, not less so
were their acts of diplomacy. One can but be
impressed with the spectacle of a handful of men
accomplishing by policy what they could never
have done by power—for years keeping at bay an
army of British troops 10,000 strong, hovering
over and in readiness to swoop down and devastate
their exposed and unprotected frontier, at
the same time the people were permitted to go
on unconcernedly about their harvest.</p>

<p>The claims to independence on the part of
Vermont were still unacknowledged by Congress,
and New York was still importunate and vexatious.
The British generals in America endeavored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
to turn these circumstances to their own account,
by detaching Vermont from the cause of
the Colonies, and making it a British province.
The first intimation that the people of Vermont
had of this circumstance was conveyed in a letter
from Colonel Beverly Robinson, dated New York,
Mar. 30th, 1780, and delivered to Colonel Ethan
Allen in the street at Arlington in July. Allen
communicated the contents of the letter to Governor
Chittenden and some others, but returned
no answer.</p>

<p>Meantime, the village of Royalton had been
sacked and burned by a party of three hundred
Indians under a British officer, four of the inhabitants
killed, and twenty-five taken prisoners. It
was arranged that the Governor should address a
communication to General Haldimand, then commanding
in Canada, proposing a cartel for the
exchange of prisoners,—the letter to be sent under
a flag to the enemy’s lines. In October, the
British appeared in great force on the lake; such
was the alarm that the Legislature, then in session<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
at Bennington, adjourned, many of the members
taking arms and hastening to the frontiers.</p>

<p>In a few days Colonel Ethan Allen received a
flag from Carleton, with an answer to Governor
Chittenden’s letter respecting the cartel. With it
was enclosed a proposition for a truce with Vermont.
Allen agreed to the proposal on condition
that the frontiers of Vermont should include the
territory to the Hudson River. This truce, however,
was not publicly known; the militia were immediately
disbanded and allowed to return home.
The militia of New York were also on their frontiers;
not being in the secret, they were surprised
to see the Vermont troops returning home, and
still more to learn that the British were retiring
to Canada.</p>

<p>In February, 1781, Colonel Robinson wrote
again to Ethan Allen, enclosing a copy of the former
letter. He was induced to make another
trial, he said, “especially as I can now write with
more authority, and assure you, that you may obtain
the terms mentioned in the above letter, provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
you and the people of Vermont take a decisive
and active part with us.”</p>

<p>Allen returned no answer to either of these
letters, but enclosed them both in a communication
to Congress. In that letter he says: “I am
confident that Congress will not dispute my sincere
attachment to my country, though I do not
hesitate to say I am fully grounded in opinion
that Vermont has an indubitable right to agree
on terms of a cessation of hostilities with Great
Britain, provided the United States persist in rejecting
her application for a union with them;
for Vermont, of all people, would be most miserable,
were she obliged to defend the independence
of the United States, and they at the same time
at full liberty to overturn and ruin the independence
of Vermont. I am as resolutely determined
to defend the independence of Vermont, as Congress
that of the United States, and rather than
fail, will retire with the hardy Green Mountain
Boys into the desolate caverns of the mountains,
and wage war with the devil, hell, and human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
nature at large.” This somewhat forcible language
was excusable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Early in that year, Vermont, by a vote of her
Legislature, adopted the policy of the States of
New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire,
that had been laying claim to the territory of the
Grants, and put in her claim of jurisdiction over
a large part of each of those States. Thus Vermont
was turning the weapons of her antagonists
upon themselves. Numbers of representatives
from the annexed districts took their seats in the
Vermont assembly. At the time of extending
her claims, she passed an act of general amnesty;
this liberal and wise act of lenity had the desired
effect.</p>

<p>The State of Vermont was at this time in a
forlorn condition; torn by intestine divisions and
the intrigues of her enemies in Congress: all the
cannons, nay, every spade and pickaxe taken by
her valiant sons at Ticonderoga and Crown Point
were removed out of the State to Fort George;
Colonel Warner’s regiment, raised in and for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
protection of Vermont, was put into Continental
service, and stationed to defend the frontiers of
New York, not half so much exposed as Vermont;
at the same time New York had recalled her State
troops from Skenesborough, while an enemy, by
coming up Lake Champlain, might land within a
day’s march of hundreds of inhabitants who were
remaining on their farms. Congress had interfered
with the internal policy of Vermont, by cutting
off her ways and means of raising money and
men for self defense by the following: “Resolved,
unanimously, that in the opinion of this body, no
unappropriated lands or estates, which are or may
be adjudged forfeited, or confiscated, lying in said
district [Vermont], ought, until the final decision
of Congress in the premises, be granted or
sold.” We transcribe, on this topic, the words
of Ira Allen:</p>

<p>“Thus left, as she had reason to suppose, by
the intrigues of those who claimed and coveted her
fertile soil, to be a prey to the common enemy,
similar to the fate of their brethren, descendants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
from Connecticut, who settled at Wyoming and
Susquehanna, and were mostly killed by a party
of Indians; their towns and villages burned, and
their country depopulated (supposed to be through
the intrigues of land-jobbers), which has since become
a prey to the Pennsylvania claimants, a
junto similar to the New York monopolists, who
were then taking every measure that the malignancy
and avarice of human nature could suggest,
for the destruction of the people of Vermont.”
That there was some foundation for this explanation
of the Wyoming massacre, is made only
too apparent by subsequent events.</p>

<p>In April, 1781, Colonel Ira Allen was commissioned
to settle a cartel with the British in Canada
for the exchange of prisoners, and also to procure
an armistice between the British forces and
Vermont. This was thought well-nigh impracticable,
as the British troops numbered 10,000 effective
men, which must remain inactive, not being
able to annoy other States without first annoying
Vermont, while the latter had only 7,000 men as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
an offset. But an armistice must be had, or the
frontiers evacuated until assistance could come
from the States whose influence had rendered
Vermont defenseless.</p>

<p>Allen arrived at Isle Aux Noix in due time,
and was accorded apartments by Major Dundas,
the officer in charge. At a convenient time Allen
observed that Congress was endeavoring to bring
Vermont into subjection to New York, but that
they, rather than yield, would see Congress subjected
to the British government, provided that
Vermont could be a distinct colony under the
Crown on safe and honorable terms; and that the
people were not disposed longer to assist a government
which might subject them and their posterity
to New York, under which they could never
be safe in person or property.</p>

<p>The replication to these observations was, that
the territory of Vermont could be a colony under
the Crown, with privileges equal to those enjoyed
by any other colony, and that those who assisted
in effecting such an event, would be duly honored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and rewarded. Much conversation passed on
the subject, of which General Haldimand was
duly informed. Nothing decisive was accomplished,
but the negotiation caused the army to
remain inactive, which was a matter of congratulation
to Allen.</p>

<p>The cartel was completed, and a verbal agreement
entered into that hostilities should cease
between Great Britain and those under the jurisdiction
of Vermont, until after the sitting of the
Legislature of that state. On Colonel Allen’s
return several influential people waited on him,
desiring to be advised whether to remain or remove
to the interior portions of the country.
Allen told them to remain quiet on their farms,
and not think it strange though they had no army
to protect the frontier; and that should any event
make it necessary, for the safety of their families,
to move, they might depend on seasonable information.
This immunity of Vermont from the aggressions
of the British, led the people on the
borders to be all the more anxious to be annexed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>to her territory, as a measure of safety to their
families and to their property.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">First Church in Vermont.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Grave suspicions having become rife that negotiations
were being carried on between Vermont
and the British in Canada, several men of discernment
among the Whigs were sent from Vermont
and the neighboring States to attend the sessions
of the Legislature, to watch if there might be
measures pursuing which would be eventually injurious
to the common cause of the United States.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the British in Canada were
anxious to know whether Allen and his friends
would be faithful, and so conduct matters as to
justify a cessation of hostilities. With these objects
in view, their representatives attended the
sessions; as the Assembly convened in the meeting
house the spectators took seats in the galleries.</p>

<p>In a few days both houses joined in a committee
to consider the subject of Ira Allen’s mission
to Canada. The Governor proceeded to state
the facts of the settlement of the cartel, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
if further particulars were desired, Colonel Allen
was then present and could best inform them.
On being requested to speak, Allen made his statement,
which showed the British had exhibited
great generosity in the transaction; and after
stating sundry things, concluded with the remark
that if any member, or auditor in the gallery,
wished to ask further questions, he was ready to
answer them.</p>

<p>Those who were in the interest of the United
States paid their compliments to Allen for his
open and candid conduct. In the evening he
had a conference with the Canadian spectators,
who seemed to be equally well pleased.</p>

<p>In July, Ethan Allen was informed by one of
his neighbors that some of his friends from Canada
wished to speak with him in the dusk of the
evening of that day. At the time appointed, Allen,
with only his cane in hand, cheerfully went
to a British guard under arms, and received a
packet. In the evening of the following day he
met them again and returned an answer. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
mode of correspondence was continued; and
whenever dispatches came in this way, General
Ethan Allen or Colonel Ira Allen (they lived in
the same house) went and received them and returned
an answer, not trusting the dispatches to
any other person. It is worthy of remark that
Sunderland, their place of residence, was more
than sixty miles from the frontiers, yet a sergeant
and guard frequently passed with their arms in
1781 and 1782, without being discovered by any
one who would inform against them.</p>

<p>About this time there appeared in the newspapers
of the day a letter from Lord George
Germain to Sir Henry Clinton, dated Whitehall,
Feb. 7th, 1781, which letter had been captured by
the French and carried to Paris, from whence it
had been forwarded to Congress, and by them ordered
to be printed. It ran thus:</p>

<p>“The return of the people of Vermont to their
allegiance is an event of the utmost importance
to the King’s affairs; and at this time, if the
French and Washington really meditate an irruption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
into Canada, may be considered as opposing
an effectual barrier to the attempt. General
Haldimand, who has the same instructions with
you to draw over those people, and give them
support, will, I doubt not, push up a body of
troops to act in conjunction with them, to secure
all the avenues through their country into Canada;
and when the season admits, take possession of
the upper parts of the Hudson and Connecticut
Rivers, and cut off the communication between
Albany and the Mohawk country. How far they
may be able to extend themselves southward or
eastward must depend on their numbers, and the
disposition of the inhabitants.”</p>

<p>This letter had greater influence on Congress
than all other considerations that had yet been
brought to bear; and that body promptly directed
that a committee be appointed to confer with
a like committee from Vermont, “on what terms
it may be proper to admit Vermont into a federal
union of these States.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, Vermont sent on her committee;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
while they were in Philadelphia they procured a
copy of a letter from the Governor of New Hampshire
to the President of Congress, stating that
his State could not furnish its quota of men or
money in support of the war, as a third part of
the State had revolted and joined Vermont. This
draft Allen transmitted to the British Commissioners
at Skenesborough, who laughed heartily
with the Vermont committee.</p>

<p>Those who are disposed to regard this action
of Allen and his associates as inimical to the
cause of American Independence, will do well to
consider that the effect was to neutralize the
strength of 10,000 British troops as opposed to
a like number from Vermont; the final result to
the cause would be the same as though both forces
took the field and slaughtered each other, with
the advantage to Vermont that she was saved
from being overrun by a devastating army.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the British Commissioners were
becoming impatient. They stated as their instructions,
which they were not at liberty to deviate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
from without putting an end to the armistice,
that his Excellency, General Haldimand,
in pursuance of full powers vested in him by his
Majesty, should issue his proclamation offering
to confirm Vermont as a colony under the Crown,
provided the people would return to their allegiance;
that an army should come up the Lake
in October with said proclamation, and the Legislature
must accept the same, and with the British
take measures for their common defense.</p>

<p>This was a sore strait for perplexed Vermont
diplomats. It was deemed best, however, to have
the proclamations brought up the Lake rather
than incur the risk of a discontinuance of the
armistice, in the present defenseless state of the
frontier.</p>

<p>The Legislature met at Charlestown early in
October, and about the same time a powerful
British army under St. Leger was landed at Ticonderoga.
A skirmish having occurred between
a party of Vermonters under command of Sergeant
Tupper and a number of the enemy, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Sergeant was killed and his men retreated. St.
Leger sent his clothes and effects, with an open
letter, to General Enos, informing him of the fate
of the Sergeant, and apologizing for his death.
This dispatch and the apparel were publicly delivered
to General Enos, which made no little
noise among the troops.</p>

<p>The preceding negotiations were not known to
more than a dozen men in Vermont. An express
came in with letters for Governor Chittenden, announcing
the arrival of the British at Ticonderoga,
in which were blended public matters and
private negotiations. The messenger had not
failed to proclaim the extraordinary message of
St. Leger, which occasioned large crowds to follow,
to hear the news. On opening the letters
the Governor saw it was not prudent to have them
publicly read. At this confused moment Major
Runnals came running in and demanded of Colonel
Allen the reason why St. Leger was sorry the
Sergeant was killed? Allen replied he could not
tell. Runnals repeated the question, to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Allen then made an evasive answer. This enraged
Runnals, who again loudly demanded what reasons
could possibly induce a British general to be
sorry when his enemies were killed? Allen retorted
with some warmth by advising Runnals to
go at the head of his regiment and demand of St.
Leger the reasons for his sorrow, and not stay
there eating up the country’s provisions and doing
nothing while the frontiers were invaded.
This manœuvre drew all attention, for the moment,
from the letters. Meanwhile new ones were made
out which were read in place of the originals for
the satisfaction of the people.</p>

<p>The crisis is approaching, yet the leaders in
the stirring drama are not dismayed. A communication
from Allen to the British announces that
matters are going on propitiously for their designs,
but in view of unfavorable reports direct
from the seat of war, suggested it would hardly
be expedient to publish the proclamation just
then. In less than an hour after this communication
reached Ticonderoga, an express arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
there with the news of the capture of Cornwallis
and his entire army. Before night the British
had embarked all their troops and stores, and had
set sail with all haste for Canada. Thus were
the Vermont diplomatists relieved, at the last moment,
from their embarrassment and danger; and
thus were the frontiers of that State preserved
from the horrors of war by the sagacity and daring
of a few determined men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br>

<small>CONCLUSION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Years elapsed. Hostilities between Great
Britain and the American Colonies had ceased;
and on the 20th of January, 1783, the preliminary
articles of peace were signed, which established
the independence of the United States. The
adoption of the Federal Constitution followed,
which was ratified by the thirteen original States,
and the first Congress assembled under it March
3d, 1789. During the period succeeding the
peace, Vermont had been pursuing the even tenor
of her way, not over-solicitous about an organic
union with the States, and without any external
foes to dread. But the ancient difference
with New York still remained unsettled. A new
political generation had come upon the stage, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
whose bosoms the bitter feuds of their fathers
were not perpetuated.</p>

<p>One difficulty, however, presented itself. New
York had aforetime granted large tracts of land
in Vermont, and the grantees were loudly complaining
of the injustice in not being allowed to
take possession of the property, or having its
purchase price refunded. New York felt no very
strong obligation to refund the money that had
been extorted for those grants by royal governors
before the war; still she was disposed to favor a
compromise. Public opinion and mutual interests
called for a reconciliation with Vermont, and
her admission into the Confederacy of States, inasmuch
as the measure would increase the representation
of New England in Congress.</p>

<p>On the 23d of October, 1789, committees from
the respective Legislatures of Vermont and New
York met to arrange the settlement of the only
issue remaining—the amount of compensation the
claimants under the New York grants should receive
from Vermont. It was agreed that on payment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
being made to her of $30,000, New York
was to consent to the admission of Vermont into
the Union, and to give up all claims to jurisdiction
within the latter State. On the 18th of February,
1791, Congress, without a dissenting voice
or vote, passed an Act “That on the 4th day of
March, 1791, the said State, by the name and
style of the ‘State of Vermont,’ shall be received
and admitted into their Union as a new and entire
member of the United States of America.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> In 1763, Rev. Samuel Peters, the first clergyman who
paid a visit to the thirty thousand settlers in that country, in
the presence of a number of landed proprietors, performed
the ceremony of giving a new name to the province, “on the
top of a rock standing on a high mountain, then named Pisgah,
because it provided the company a clear sight of Lake
Champlain to the west, and of the Connecticut River to the
east, and which overlooked all the trees and hills in the vast
wilderness at the north and south,” ... which new name
is “Verd Mont,” in token that her mountains and hills shall
ever be green and never die. He then poured the spirits
about him and cast the bottle at the rock. The ceremony being
